# Features that would be nice to add

## Some kind of life cycle management for Jobs

I started this with the 'finished' flag. But actually it's
complicated to get right and would need long conversations
with a Product Owner and some A/B testing to get right.

## Some kind of life cycle management for Applications

For example once a person is rejected, perhaps they 
should be remove.

Like the above, this is complicated to get right and needs
experiments and A/B testing

## Ordering and Paging of questions and sections

This is a nice to have, but not essential for the MVP

It would be nice to show the sections in some kind of order,
even though quite often the order the interviews / candidate
details being filled can be variable (is the HR interview before
or after the technical interviews?)

Similar with the questions.

Pagination would be needed if we got a hundred applicants for a job, or
had a hundred jobs.

## Allow managers to do more

Talk over with a product owner to get requirements

## Allow a job owner or manager to view interviewers.

ALlow a view of 'all the things this person is doing for me'. This lets
us identify people that are overloaded, or not doing enough.
